# VELTRIX — Brokerage Demonstration Platform

VELTRIX is a **demonstration** multi-asset investment platform for EU-facing customers.
It pairs the original static marketing site with a real **Flask + SQLite** backend that
provides authentication, demo accounts, paper trading, portfolios, a support queue and an
administrator dashboard.

> **This is a demo, not a real brokerage.** All prices, balances, orders and transactions
> are **simulated**. No real money is received, held, deposited, withdrawn or invested.
> No order is sent to any broker, exchange or market. Nothing here is investment advice.

## 1. What is in this repository

| Area | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static marketing site (GitHub Pages) | `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js` | The original premium concept landing site. Preserved and lightly corrected. |

## 2. Features implemented

**Client**
- Register / sign in / sign out with hashed passwords and CSRF-protected forms.
- Client dashboard: demo balance, positions value, total equity, watchlist, recent activity, market summary.
- Markets page: search by symbol/name, filter by asset class, 16 seeded instruments across
  stocks, crypto, forex, commodities and indices.
- Watchlist add/remove per user.
- Simulated buy/sell orders with validation, position tracking and an average-price model.
- Portfolio with holdings, cost basis and unrealised P/L.
- Transaction history (side, instrument, quantity, execution price, amount, status, timestamp).
- Demo top-up that adds **fictional** funds and records an auditable simulated transaction.
- Support centre: submit a request and track its status; requests are private to the user.

**Administrator**
- Server-enforced admin-only area (`/admin`).
- Platform statistics, user list (no secrets shown), all simulated transactions, support queue.
- Update support request status (open / in progress / resolved).

**Platform**
- Read-only JSON API (`/api/instruments`) for the static site to consume.
- Health endpoint (`/health`).
- Responsive dark UI reusing the VELTRIX design language; mobile navigation, empty/loading/error
  states, keyboard focus styles and reduced-motion support.

## 3. Features that are intentionally simulated / not implemented

- No real market data feed. Prices are **seeded, illustrative examples** and are labelled
  "Illustrative demo prices — not live market data."
- No real deposits, withdrawals, payment provider or card handling.
- No real order execution, custody, settlement or clearing.
- No real KYC/AML processing. No identity documents are collected.
- No real human support staff. The support queue is a demo workflow, not a staffed 24/7 service.
- No multi-currency conversion; demo cash is a single configured currency (USD by default).

## 4. Technology stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.11, Flask 3.1, Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.1, Flask-Login, Flask-WTF,
  WTForms, Werkzeug (scrypt password hashing), python-dotenv.
- **Database:** SQLite for local development (PostgreSQL-compatible SQLAlchemy models).
- **Tests:** pytest.
- **Frontend:** server-rendered Jinja templates + a small vanilla-JS enhancement file (no build step).
- **Static site:** plain HTML/CSS/JS (unchanged stack), deployable to GitHub Pages.

## 5. Local setup

```powershell
# 1. Go to the backend
cd backend

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1        # Windows PowerShell
# source .venv/bin/activate         # macOS / Linux

# 3. Install dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure the environment (optional locally)
Copy-Item .env.example .env
#   Edit .env and set a strong SECRET_KEY.

# 5. Create the database and seed the demo instruments
python -m flask --app run seed

# 6. Run the development server
python run.py
#   -> http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Database location

- Default: `backend/instance/veltrix.db` (SQLite). The `instance/` folder and `*.db`
  files are excluded from version control.
- Override with the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, e.g.
  `postgresql+psycopg://user:pass@host:5432/veltrix`.
- The app creates missing tables on start; `flask --app run seed` loads the demo instruments.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Signs session cookies and CSRF tokens. **Required in production.** | insecure dev value + warning |
| `FLASK_ENV` | `development` / `testing` / `production` | `development` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLAlchemy database URL | `sqlite:///backend/instance/veltrix.db` |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` | Set `1` to send cookies only over HTTPS (production) | `0` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated frontend origins allowed to call `/api/*` | empty |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Optional: bootstrap a dev admin during `seed` | empty |
| `ADMIN_NAME` | Display name for the seeded admin | `Veltrix Admin` |
| `DEMO_STARTING_BALANCE` | Fictional starting cash for a new demo account | `10000.00` |
| `HOST` / `PORT` | Bind address for `python run.py` | `127.0.0.1` / `5000` |

> Never commit a real `.env`. `.env` is git-ignored. No secrets are hard-coded.

### Creating an administrator

No predictable admin account is shipped. To create one for local development:

```powershell
$env:ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@yourdomain.example"
$env:ADMIN_PASSWORD="a-strong-unique-password"
python -m flask --app run seed
```

Admins can reach `/admin`. Ordinary clients receive **HTTP 403** on admin routes.

---

## 6. Running the tests

```powershell
cd backend
python -m pytest
```

**Actual result (this build):**

```
35 passed in ~25s
```

The suite covers: application startup, DB initialisation, registration, duplicate-email
handling, registration validation, successful/failed login, logout, client-route protection,
admin-route protection (403 for clients, redirect for anonymous), cross-user data isolation,
market search and filtering, watchlist add/remove, invalid/insufficient trade inputs, buy/sell
balance and position accounting, average price, transaction history, demo top-up, support
request creation and isolation, admin status updates, CSRF rejection, the JSON API and the
health endpoint.

HTTP smoke test against a running server (`python run.py`):

```
GET /            -> 200
GET /markets/    -> 200
GET /login       -> 200
GET /health      -> {"status":"ok","database":"up","mode":"simulation"}
register -> dashboard -> simulated buy -> transaction history -> support request  (all OK)
GET /admin/ (as client) -> 403
```

## 7. Try the complete demo flow

1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` and click **Open a demo account**.
2. Register (any email; password ≥ 8 characters). You start with fictional demo funds.
3. On the **Dashboard**, review balance, watchlist and market summary.
4. Open **Markets**, search/filter, and add a couple of instruments to your watchlist.
5. Open an instrument and place a **simulated buy** (try a fractional quantity for e.g. `BTC/USD`).
6. Check **Portfolio** and **Activity** for updated balances and the transaction record.
7. Try to sell more than you own, or buy more than your demo cash allows — the order is rejected.
8. Use **Add demo funds** on the portfolio page (adds fictional funds only).
9. Submit a **Support request** and see its status.
10. As an admin (`/admin`), review users, transactions and support requests, and update a status.

---

## 8. GitHub Pages + backend deployment

GitHub Pages serves **static files only** — it cannot run Flask or host a persistent database.
The two parts deploy independently:

1. **Static concept site** stays on GitHub Pages (as it is today).
2. **Flask backend** is deployed as a separate service (Render, Railway, Fly.io, a VPS with
   gunicorn/waitress, etc.). Start it with the WSGI entry point:

   ```bash
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi:app      # Linux
   waitress-serve --port=8000 wsgi:app          # Windows
   ```

   Set `SECRET_KEY`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=1`, a production `DATABASE_URL` (e.g. Postgres
   because SQLite files do not persist reliably on every host) and `CORS_ORIGINS` to your
   Pages origin.

3. **Connect the frontend to the backend:** set the `veltrix-app-url` meta tag in
   `index.html` to the deployed backend URL, e.g.

   ```html
   <meta name="veltrix-app-url" content="https://veltrix-demo.onrender.com">
   ```

   When set, the "Log in", "Open an account" and dashboard buttons on the static site link to
   the live demo. When empty, the original in-page preview is used and the site keeps working
   exactly as before. The static site can also read demo prices from `GET /api/instruments`
   (narrow CORS is configured server-side via `CORS_ORIGINS`).

> The backend in this repository has **not** been deployed. It runs locally; deployment is the
> documented next step.

## 9. Security notes

- Passwords are hashed with Werkzeug's scrypt-based `generate_password_hash`; plaintext is
  never stored or logged.
- State-changing forms are CSRF-protected (Flask-WTF); missing/invalid tokens are rejected.
- Sessions use `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookies; `Secure` is enabled via config in production.
- All database access goes through the SQLAlchemy ORM (parameterised queries).
- Registration/login return generic errors to avoid account enumeration.
- Admin routes are authorised on the server (`admin_required`), not merely hidden in the UI.
- A per-user data boundary prevents reading another user's transactions or support requests.
- The admin UI never displays password hashes or other sensitive values.
- CORS for the JSON API is limited to explicitly configured origins and read-only (`GET`).

## 10. Known limitations

- SQLite is intended for local/demo use; production needs a server database (see §8).
- No email delivery: password recovery is not implemented (there is no recovery flow in the app).
- Prices are static seed values; there is no scheduler or live feed.
- No rate limiting on auth endpoints (recommended before any public deployment).
- No multi-currency support and no realised-P/L reporting.
- The static concept site's preview forms remain non-functional by design.

## 11. Recommended next steps

1. Deploy the backend (Postgres + gunicorn/waitress) and set `veltrix-app-url` on the Pages site.
2. Add rate limiting and login throttling (e.g. Flask-Limiter).
3. Add an audited, append-only ledger for transactions; separate "risk" review states.
4. Integrate a legitimate market-data provider for the `Instrument` prices (kept out of scope here).
5. Add email verification and a real password-recovery flow.
6. Expand admin tooling: user suspension, CSV export, audit log persistence.
